# Starter Custom Entity Component System Framework for Godot Engine & C#

This is a simple starter project implementing my Entity Component System (ECS) framework. It includes the app manager, a basic visual system, a console and it is 100% functional. 
Although Godot encougares a pure OOP, I think that not only it's possible to combine it with and ECS, but handy when prototyping. Furthermore, with some tweaks it's possible to adapt the whole ECS to differents engines, as Unity (this is where my framework began) and Monogame (not tested yet). 

The "roguelite_tuto" (unfinished project) uses this aproach.
